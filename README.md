# Problems

Due to my lack of exposure to SQL, I was struggling a lot to finish this module. It took me a lot longer than normal even for simple things such as importing the CSVs. Since SQL places such a high value on accuracy and is a static language, this definitely was a struggle. I think more than anything completing the Module Assignment was tough. However, I am confident that I will make a solid recovery.
